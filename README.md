# MI-AFP homework #00

Dummy homework for explanation and showing the workflow

## Task

Your task is just to try the workflow of doing homeworks:

1. Create your own (private) repository and invite teacher(s) as collaborator(s)
2. Set-up the upstream to this repository and get the content (it is better than copy/paste if there will be some fixes later on)
3. Do the changes in separate branch (name is up to you, e.g., `solution`)
4. Complete the task - use `stack` (esp. `stack test`, but also `stack ghci` can be useful), visit `test/` to see the expected behavior of your implementation in `src`
5. Create pull request and request a review from teacher(s)
6. Wait for the review... :coffee:

## Notes 

 * This homework is optional but highly recommended.
 * If you encounter some trouble, create an issue in your repository.
 * In case you find abug or have an idea how to improve assignment project, create an issue or PR in this repository.
